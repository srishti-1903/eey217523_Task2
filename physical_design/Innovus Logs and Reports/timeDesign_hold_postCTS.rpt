**WARN: (IMPEXT-3493):	The design extraction status has been reset by set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner or setExtractRCMode  command. The parasitic data can be regenerated either by extracting the design using the extractRC command or by loading the SPEF or RCDB file(s). To prevent resetting of the extraction status, avoid changing extraction modes.
Type 'man IMPEXT-3493' for more detail.
